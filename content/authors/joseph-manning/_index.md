role: Postdoctoral Research Associate
# weight: 
bio: I study the ways in which porous materials are synthesized to ease the transition towards manufacture and widespread realisation of their benefits. <br  /><br  />Particularly, I'm interested in exploring how unusual behaviour of chemicals trapped within pore spaces complicates scale-up and how understanding fundamental physical chemistry at the pore surface can resolve these. 
interests: [templated nanomaterials, surface chemistry, process intensification, confined fluids]
